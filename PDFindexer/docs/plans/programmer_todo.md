# Programmer Todo

Read docs/plans/design.md fully before starting any task.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] Create requirements.txt with pdfplumber and pytest
- [x] Set up venv and install dependencies
- [x] Create pdfindexer/ package directory with __init__.py
- [x] Create tests/ directory with conftest.py
- [x] Verify pdfplumber can open and read the source PDF

## Phase 2: TOC Parser

- [x] Write failing test for TOC extraction using tests/fixtures/ac_43_13_excerpt.pdf
- [x] Implement toc_parser.py — extracts chapter/section/paragraph structure from TOC pages
      Output: list of chapter dicts with nested sections and paragraphs
- [x] Verify parser produces correct structure for Chapter 1 (all 4 sections, all paragraphs)
      Note: reserved paragraph ranges (1-12 to 1-17 etc.) are absent from TOC — handled correctly

## Phase 3: Page Text Extractor

- [x] Write failing test for two-column extraction using tests/fixtures/ac_43_13_excerpt.pdf
- [x] Implement page_extractor.py — extracts text with column awareness, strips header/footer,
      detects figures; classifies lines as full-width, left-col, or right-col based on x position
- [x] 10 tests passing
      Note: table detection deferred to doc_parser phase; tables appear across pages 36+ in fixture

## Phase 4: Document Parser

- [x] Write failing tests for paragraph boundary detection
- [x] Implement doc_parser.py — walks content pages, splits text into paragraphs,
      attaches chapter/section metadata, inserts [FIG] and [TABLE] markers,
      joins hyphenated line-break words
- [x] 12 tests passing; multi-page paragraphs and sub-paragraphs handled correctly

## Phase 5: Output Writer

- [x] Write failing tests for output format
- [x] Implement output_writer.py — writes ch##_p###.txt paragraph files and index.txt
      - Paragraph files: plain text, header line + content, no markdown
      - index.txt: chapter/section/paragraph listing with filenames
      - Filenames zero-padded to 3 digits using paragraph number within chapter
- [x] 10 tests passing; 37 total

## Phase 6: Main Entry Point

- [x] Implement __main__.py — orchestrates full pipeline with CLI args (pdf_path, output_dir, --toc-end)
- [x] Ran against full ac_43.13.pdf: 648/656 paragraphs extracted (98.8%), 649 files written
      Known gaps (8 paragraphs not found in body text): 9-17, 10-17, 11-54/55/56, 12-70/71/72
      Chapter 13 (Human Factors) has no body content in this PDF edition
      Fixed duplicate paragraph detection bug — merged cross-column re-occurrences correctly

## Phase 7: Full Run and Validation

- [x] Run against full ac_43.13.pdf, writing output to data/
- [x] Verified file count: 648 paragraph files + index.txt = 649 total
- [x] Spot-checked paragraph files — content accurate, headers correct, markers working
- [x] index.txt confirmed: 13 chapters, all sections, 648/656 paragraphs with filenames
- [x] 8 paragraphs listed in index without filenames (not detectable from body text layout)
- [x] Reported known gaps to Architect above
