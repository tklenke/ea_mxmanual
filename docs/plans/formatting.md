# Formatting

This document defines formatting conventions for the ea_mxmanual maintenance manual. It covers page naming, callout formats, citations, and cross-references.

**Note to Writer:** This document will be published in the Otterwiki alongside Manual Standards and Writing Style.

---

## Page and Section Naming

- Page names use `lowercase-hyphenated` format (e.g., `brake-system-fluid-choice`)
- Wiki links use `[[page-name|Display Text]]` format
- Section headings: Title Case for top-level, sentence case for sub-sections
- Names must describe content, not document history or status
- NEVER use temporal or status terms in names (e.g., "new-procedure", "updated-checklist", "revised-spec")
- Names must be evergreen — valid regardless of when they are read

---

## NOTE Callouts

### General Note

Use a NOTE to call out important information that does not fit in the main flow of a procedure or description.

```
> **NOTE:** [Text of note here.]
```

**Example:**
> **NOTE:** Torque values apply to dry, unlubricated fasteners unless otherwise specified.

---

### Source Conflict Note

When a manufacturer Technical Data Sheet (TDS) conflicts with AC 43.13 and the TDS is followed, a source conflict NOTE is required.

```
> **NOTE:** This [procedure/specification/value] follows [TDS name] ([tds/filename]) rather
> than AC 43.13 ([ch##_p###]). Where these sources conflict, the manufacturer's Technical
> Data Sheet takes precedence. See both documents for full context.
```

**Fields:**
- `[procedure/specification/value]` — what specifically is affected (e.g., "cure time", "torque specification")
- `[TDS name]` — the common name of the TDS (e.g., "Permatex Thread Sealant TDS")
- `[tds/filename]` — the filename in `docs/references/tds/`
- `[ch##_p###]` — the AC 43.13 chapter and page reference (e.g., `ch01_p001`)

**Example:**
> **NOTE:** This cure time follows the Permatex Thread Sealant TDS (`Permatex_Thread_Sealant_TDS.pdf`) rather than AC 43.13 (ch01_p001). Where these sources conflict, the manufacturer's Technical Data Sheet takes precedence. See both documents for full context.

---

## Citing Sources

All specific values, procedures, and specifications MUST include an inline citation.

- AC 43.13: `(AC 43.13, ch01_p001)`
- TDS: `(Permatex Thread Sealant TDS)`

If a value cannot be traced to a source in `docs/references/`, flag it with `@@TOM:` rather than presenting it without attribution.

---

## Table of Contents

For long pages, place a `[TOC]` tag immediately after the page's H1 header. OtterWiki will render an in-page table of contents at that location, linking to all `##` and `###` headings on the page.

```markdown
# Page Title

[TOC]

## First Section
...
```

Use `[TOC]` on any page with four or more sections. Omit it on short pages where a TOC adds no navigation value.

---

## Cross-References

When content in one section refers to a procedure or topic covered in another section, use a wiki link rather than duplicating the content.

**Format:** `See [[page-name|Page Title]] in Section N.`

**Example:** `See [[panels-cowling|Cowling]] in Section 9 for removal procedure.`

Do not duplicate procedures. One section owns each procedure; all others point to it.
