# Architect Todo

## In Progress

## Backlog

### [x] Design input file archiving for writer_todo and feedback drop zones (2026-04-17)

Files are renamed in place with a `_pending` suffix after being consumed (e.g.,
`task.md` → `task_pending.md`). Deleted after work is approved. No archive directories
needed — drop zones are gitignored. Updated `claude/roles/writer.md` and
`claude/roles/architect.md`.

### [x] Verify wikiCheck "pending" status fix (2026-04-17)

Verified 2026-04-17. All three criteria met:
- Pending pages show under "Pending pages" summary line with correct count (7)
- Pending pages do NOT appear under "Pages missing from log"
- `--detail` output includes a "Pending pages" section listing them

### [x] Writer todo update workflow — add to Writer role (2026-04-17)

Writer marks tasks `[x]` complete after Tom's explicit sign-off, not before. Updated `claude/roles/writer.md` workflow and pre-commit check accordingly. Also removed Progress Tracking Review section from `claude/roles/reviewer.md` — Reviewer is not the todo police; timing was wrong anyway (todo updates after sign-off, Reviewer commits at sign-off).

---

### [x] OtterWiki navigation sidebar strategy — confirmed Option C (2026-04-17)

Tom confirmed OtterWiki built-in auto-generated sidebar is the permanent approach. No hand-maintained sidebar file needed.

## Completed

### [x] Update TDS citation format in docs/plans/formatting.md (2026-04-17)

AR source already had the correct filename format. No change needed.

### [x] Add AR-update flow to Reviewer role instructions (2026-04-17)

Added "When AR Sources Need Updates" section to `claude/roles/reviewer.md`. Reviewer fixes wiki page, logs task in architect_todo.md, does not touch AR sources directly.

### [x] Verify wikiCheck output and integrate into Reviewer role (2026-04-17)

Ran `wiki_check.py --detail` against WR — output accurate. 82 broken links expected (TOC pages not yet written). 4 false-positive slugs from templates.md documented in `docs/notes/wikicheck_ignored_links.md`. Updated `claude/roles/reviewer.md` with wikiCheck startup sequence. Created `docs/notes/review_log.md`. Updated `claude/project_status.md`.

### [x] Review wikiCheck orphan detection (2026-04-17)

Output correct and useful. No orphans currently — expected at this stage. Integrated into Reviewer role startup. Orphan design: wikiCheck live scan is authoritative; Writer resolves by finding a valid link target; escalates to Architect if none exists.
