# Architect Todo

## Active: Consolidate tools/ shared structure (2026-04-16)

**Goal:** As tools/ grows beyond PDFindexer to include wikiCheck and future tools, lift
shared concerns (acronyms, style guide, architect oversight) to tools/docs/ so they
don't drift per-tool. Keep per-tool plans/design/programmer_todo where they belong.

### Target structure

```
tools/
  docs/
    acronyms.md              <- lifted from PDFindexer/docs/; shared across all tools
    style-guide.md           <- lifted from PDFindexer/docs/; shared across all tools
    plans/
      architect_todo.md      <- this file; single view of all cross-tool architect work
  PDFindexer/
    docs/
      plans/
        design.md            <- keep (tool-specific)
        programmer_todo.md   <- keep (tool-specific)
        required_from_tom.md <- keep (tool-specific)
      references/            <- keep (tool-specific, READ ONLY)
      # acronyms.md REMOVED (moved to tools/docs/)
      # style-guide.md REMOVED (moved to tools/docs/)
      # plans/architect_todo.md REMOVED (merged here)
  wikiCheck/
    docs/
      plans/
        design.md            <- to be created (wikiCheck spec)
        programmer_todo.md   <- to be created
        # plans/architect_todo.md REMOVED (merged here)
  claude/
    roles/
      architect.md           <- update path references
      programmer.md          <- update path references
      code_reviewer.md       <- update path references
    project_status.md        <- update to multi-tool scope + new paths
  CLAUDE.md                  <- update path references
```

### Implementation steps

- [x] Create tools/docs/plans/ directory
- [x] Write this architect_todo.md
- [x] git mv PDFindexer/docs/acronyms.md → tools/docs/acronyms.md
- [x] git mv PDFindexer/docs/style-guide.md → tools/docs/style-guide.md
- [x] Merge PDFindexer architect_todo content into this file (PDFindexer section below)
- [x] Remove tools/PDFindexer/docs/plans/architect_todo.md (content merged here)
- [x] Merge wikiCheck architect_todo content into this file (wikiCheck section below)
- [x] Remove tools/wikiCheck/docs/plans/architect_todo.md (content merged here)
- [x] Update claude/roles/architect.md path references
- [x] Update claude/roles/programmer.md path references
- [x] Update claude/roles/code_reviewer.md path references
- [x] Update claude/project_status.md — multi-tool scope, new shared paths
- [x] Update tools/CLAUDE.md if it references old paths
- [x] Commit

## pdf_page_to_svg.py — PDF diagram extraction tool (2026-04-18)

**What was done:** A standalone script `tools/pdf_page_to_svg.py` was created to extract
a single PDF page as an editable SVG using PyMuPDF (`fitz`). Unlike `pdftocairo`, PyMuPDF
preserves text as real `<text>/<tspan>` elements with readable content, making the SVG
easy to edit by y-coordinate filtering or content.

The script was used to extract Figure 2-1 (G3X system architecture diagram) from
`docs/references/tds/GarminG3XInstallationManual_az.pdf` page 25. The resulting SVG
(77KB vs 479KB for pdftocairo) lives at `docs/references/diagrams/g3x-system-architecture.svg`
in the AR.

**Open question for Architect:** `pdf_page_to_svg.py` currently lives loose in `tools/`.
Consider whether it warrants its own subdirectory (similar to `PDFindexer/`) as PDF
extraction scope grows — e.g., if we need to extract more diagrams from the G3X manual
or other PDFs. A `tools/PDFExtractor/` or `tools/pdftools/` directory with its own
design.md and venv setup instructions may be appropriate.

**Requires pymupdf:** `pip install pymupdf`. A venv was set up at `/tmp/pdfenv/` during
the session that created this — ephemeral, not committed. Document venv setup if this
tool gets its own directory.

## PDFindexer

### Completed (as of 2026-04-15)

Initial design, library selection, output format, pipeline design, token optimization,
all documented in design.md. CMW (claude-maintenance-writer) defined as consumer.

Design revisions after implementation review:
- CHG 1 format: body text uses no period after paragraph number; Chapter 13 has no
  section headers in TOC. Both documented in design.md "CHG 1 Format" section.
- Three appendices confirmed (Glossary p.633-641, Acronyms p.642-645, Metric p.646).
  Extraction approach and filenames documented in design.md.
- Soft hyphen (U+00AD) found in CHG 1 pages — fix must strip \xad before joining.

### Open

- [ ] Validate index.txt and spot-check output files once Phases 8-10 are complete
- [ ] Confirm output is usable by CMW after full pipeline re-run
- [ ] README.md review once Programmer drafts it (Phase 10)

## wikiCheck

### Status: Complete (2026-04-18)

All phases complete, 103 tests passing. Design documented in `wikiCheck/docs/plans/design.md`.
