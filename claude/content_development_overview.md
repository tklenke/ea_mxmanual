## Repository Structure

This project uses two git repositories:

- **Agent Repo (AR)** — `/home/tom/projects/ea_mxmanual` — all changes under this directory are committed to the AR.
- **Wiki Repo (WR)** — `/home/tom/projects/N657CZDashTwo` — all changes under this directory are committed to the WR.

**Writer note:** All manual content pages (wiki Markdown files) are written to and committed from the WR. The AR contains planning documents, standards, and reference materials only.

When committing, verify you are in the correct repository before running `git add` or `git commit`.

## WR Asset Directories

Static assets (non-Markdown files) are stored in the WR under `assets/`:

- **`assets/diagrams/`** — SVG diagrams (system interconnects, component layouts, etc.)
- **`assets/schematics/`** — electrical schematics and wiring diagrams
- **`assets/photos/`** — photographs of components, installations, etc.

Add new asset type subdirectories only when content exists for them. Do not create directories speculatively.

**Naming convention:** `secNN-descriptive-name.ext` — include the section number so assets are identifiable without navigating the directory. Example: `sec17-g3x-system-interconnect.svg`.

**Source files:** Working/editable source files for assets (e.g., AR copies of SVGs being edited) live in `docs/references/diagrams/` in the AR. The WR copy is the published version; the AR copy is the working copy.

## Writing Style and Formatting

Content standards are split across three documents. Read all three:

- **`docs/plans/style.md`** — voice, tense, and language rules
- **`docs/plans/formatting.md`** — page naming, NOTE formats, citations, cross-references
- **`docs/plans/templates.md`** — standard page structures by page type

These apply to all manual content regardless of role.


## Version Control

- If the project isn't in a git repo, STOP and ask permission to initialize one.
- YOU MUST STOP and ask how to handle uncommitted changes or untracked files when starting work. Suggest committing existing work first.
- Both repos (AR and WR) commit directly to main. Do not create branches without Tom's explicit approval. If you see a reason to branch, raise it with Tom and wait for a decision before proceeding.
- YOU MUST track all non-trivial changes in git.
- YOU MUST commit frequently throughout the writing process, even if high-level tasks are not yet done.
- NEVER SKIP, EVADE OR DISABLE A PRE-COMMIT HOOK
- NEVER use `git add -A` unless you've just done a `git status` — don't add unintended files to the repo.


## Issue Tracking

- You MUST use your TodoWrite tool to keep track of what you're doing.
- You MUST NEVER discard tasks from your TodoWrite todo list without Tom's explicit approval.


## Architectural Decisions

Structural decisions about the manual — scope, section organization, content boundaries, and design rationale — are recorded in `docs/plans/architecture_decisions.md` and published in the wiki as [[Manual Standards|manual-standards]].

The wiki page is a published snapshot. `docs/plans/architecture_decisions.md` remains the working copy for the Architect to update. After significant changes, the Writer should re-publish by updating `manual-standards.md` in the WR.

## Learning and Memory Management
NOTE: Journaling functionality may be added in the future to help track research findings, failed approaches, architectural decisions, and user preferences across conversations. This section is a placeholder for that capability.


## Reference Materials

All reference materials are in `docs/references/` and are **READ ONLY**. Never modify these files.

### Available References

- **`docs/references/AC43_13/`** — FAA Advisory Circular 43.13, *Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices — Aircraft Inspection and Repair*. Files are named by chapter and page (e.g., `ch01_p001.txt`). Appendices are also available. This is the baseline reference for general aircraft maintenance practices.

- **`docs/references/tds/`** — Manufacturer Technical Data Sheets and installation guides for specific products used on the aircraft (e.g., sealants, adhesives, thread compounds, component install guides).
- **`docs/references/checklists/`** — Community and source reference checklists used as inputs during content development (e.g., the Zeitlin ACI checklist).

- **`docs/acronyms.md`** — list of acronymns used during development.  not necessarily for inclusion in the content.  short hand for discussions between Claude and Tom.  When Tom uses a term followed by a parenthesis with an acronym that means "here's a new one add it to this file."  Read this file on startup.

### How to Use References

When writing content that involves a procedure, specification, or value:

1. Check `docs/references/AC43_13/` for the relevant chapter and page
2. Check `docs/references/tds/` for any applicable manufacturer TDS
3. If both sources apply, they must both be cited

### Source Hierarchy and Conflicts

**When AC 43.13 and a manufacturer TDS conflict, the TDS takes precedence.**

The manufacturer's Technical Data Sheet specifies requirements for their specific product. AC 43.13 provides general guidance that may not account for product-specific requirements.

When a TDS supersedes AC 43.13:
- Follow the TDS
- Add a source conflict NOTE to the content (see `docs/plans/standards.md` for NOTE format)
- Cite both sources — the TDS that was followed and the AC 43.13 section it supersedes

### Citing Sources

Citation format is defined in `docs/plans/style_guide.md`. If a value cannot be traced to a source in `docs/references/`, flag it with `@@TOM:` for resolution rather than presenting it without attribution.
